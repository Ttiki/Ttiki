### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--**Ttiki/Ttiki** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

My name is ClÃ©ment Combier, also known as Ttiki online. I am a programmer since my youngest age, always loving algorithms puzzles and being a nerd for science in general.
Since 2020 (officially) I have been making games for my own studio Jostatu. It was always my dream to have my studio, making my games, each with their stories and world to explore. 
I've also been making mods for the Source Engine since 2015 / 2016. I've been making software in C# for as long.
I've always been interested in computer science. Being able to control a computer, do whatever you want with it. A power that, in my opinion, is overseen by too many people nowadays. 
I'm always learning, I never want to stop, it's too much important in science, and in this world, people should not forget that.
